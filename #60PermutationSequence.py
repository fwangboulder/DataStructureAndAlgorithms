The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

Recursive Solution

Imagine N = 4 and K = 14
Permutations starting with 1: (2,3,4)! = 6. Total Perms ending with 1 as first element = 6.
Permutations starting with 2: (1,3,4)! = 6. Total Perms ending with 2 as first element = 12.
Permutations starting with 3: (2,1,4)! = 6. Total Perms ending with 3 as first element = 18.
So the 14th permutation should start with 3. The problem reduces to finding the second permutation with input as [1,2 4]. nums = [1,2,4] and K=2.
Permutations starting with 1: (2,4)! = 2. Total Perms ending with 1 as first element = 2.
Permutations starting with 2: (1,4)! = 2. Total Perms ending with 2 as first element = 4.
So the 2nd permutation should start with 1. The problem reduced to finding the second permutation with input as [2,4]. nums = [2,4] and K = 2.
Permutations starting with 2: (4)! = 1. Total Perms ending with 2 as first element = 1
Permutations starting with 4: (2)! = 1. Total Perms ending with 4 as first element = 2
So the 2nd permutation should start with 4. The problem reduces to finding the first permutation with input as [2]. nums = [2] and K = 1. This is the base condition: K=1 just return since nums has the right permutation
